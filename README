These are a collection of scripts which scrape data from the Des Moines Register Iowa Lobbyist Disclosure database and put it a easier to query sqlite3 database.

Scripts:

download_html.rb: Pulls each search page from "http://data.desmoinesregister.com/results/index.php?info=lobbyists_details&BRSR=0&displayStyle=1&submit=&Lobbyist=&Client=&Industry=&Type=&Pay=&OutOfState=&notes_orig=&sort=Pay&desc=desc&update=Sort#tbl" and dumps it into the raw-html directory

process_html.rb: Goes through each html file in the raw-html database, and for each lobbyist record, creates an entry in the sqlite3 database
